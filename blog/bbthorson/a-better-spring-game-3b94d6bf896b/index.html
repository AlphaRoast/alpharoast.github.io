<p>Have you played college football? If not, let me tell you a little secret: football practice in the Spring is <strong><em>the worst</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Seriously.</strong></p>
<p>Fall camp is really brutal, but there’s an end goal. In Spring Ball your only goal is to be done with Spring Ball.</p>
<p>I’m heading back to my alma mater next weekend for our annual Spring Game and it dawned on me that this is a ridiculous event.</p>
<p>Spring Ball is about teaching young players the playbook and starting to solidify the fall depth chart (5 months in advance…), but around a third of the a way through you’ve installed the playbook.</p>
<p>From then on it’s mostly running the same plays at the same defense and a matter of which side cheats more. On top of that, because there’s no game of consequence at the end of the rainbow, workouts don’t get easier.</p>
<p><strong>It’s just not fun.</strong></p>
<p>And hell, when you’re not getting paid there should be something enjoyable. Athletes live to compete so give us competition.</p>
<h3 id="i-have-a-solution">I have a solution!<a class="anchor" href="#i-have-a-solution">#</a></h3>
<p>Ok, it’s half baked but it’s a start. Listen up.</p>
<p>College football does one thing far better than the NFL: <strong>overtime</strong>. It’s abbreviated, both in field length and time, which is great.</p>
<p>This compact form of football is [almost] always pretty damn exciting. Ergo…</p>
<p>Take the SEC for example. Splitting into East and West divisions, each of their 14 teams could expect to play 6 overtime games over the course of a weekend. Those SEC fans would go <em>nuts</em>.</p>
<p>I mean they are already nuts but you get my point.</p>
<p>It’s a great opportunity for the conference and fans to engage. Speaking from experience, basketball conference tournaments are one hell of a weekend (looking at you BigXII).</p>
<p>It’s also a great opportunity for teams to work on a rare, but extremely important game phases: the red zone and overtime.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it’s a great opportunity for the players. They get to prepare and play against real competition, simulate fall game prep, and have a nice event to bookend their Spring Ball hell.</p>
<p>Plus, think of all the damn money it would make. Isn’t that what college athletics is about after all?</p>
