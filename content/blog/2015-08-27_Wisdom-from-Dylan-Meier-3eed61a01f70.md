Cleaning out my car this morning, I found a quote from Dylan that rang especially true with me.

Dylan would have been 30 years young last Friday. He was wise well beyond his years.

> _I’m truly grateful to have the family I have. Seeing and being with them is what I value as love… unconventional love and an abundance of security, smiles, and memories; unforgettable memories._

> _\-DQM_

Dylan, we miss you and we love you.

**Get busy livin’ or get busy dyin’.**
