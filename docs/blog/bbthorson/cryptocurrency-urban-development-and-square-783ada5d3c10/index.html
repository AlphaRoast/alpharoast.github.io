<p><em>16 DECEMBER 2013</em></p>
<p>Those three things seem really unrelated, but stick with me for a few minutes and maybe I can make some sense of them. There’s definite holes in my ideas, but it’s a start.</p>
<h4 id="cryptocurrency-what">Cryptocurrency… What?</h4>
<p><em>Think Bitcoin.</em></p>
<p>If you haven’t heard of Bitcoin by now I’m amazed. Regardless, it’s actually not as complex of a concept as pundits would make you believe.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a ledger. It’s distributed and uses algorithms to verify transactions, eliminating the need for a central bank. In that way, it’s rather beautiful.</p>
<h4 id="and-urban-development">And Urban Development?</h4>
<p>Recently I’ve read a lot about the concept of Basic Income, and I have to say it’s rather intriguing. The United States has fostered a system of corporatism which continuously neglects the disenfranchised. Our cities are rife with crime, homelessness, and drug abuse largely due to a lack of oppotunity.</p>
<p>Yet these opportunities are increasingly automated and wealth inequity continues to grow. Working in tech, I feel we can better leverage the tools at our disposal to help the disenfranchised. With different spending incentives maybe our cities would be thriving communities.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies give us the power to design “money”. We’re no longer inhibited by a one size fits all approach to buying and selling. For urban development an ideal currency would reward spending locally and often; it would help small merchants attract customers and reward repeat shopping.</p>
<h4 id="where-does-square-comein">Where does Square come in?</h4>
<p>Distribution. I know I said cryptocurrencies don’t need a central bank but we’re directing our efforts geographically; there needs to be a nexus of distribution. It’s got to be effortless for buyers and sellers and if anyone gets how to do that it’s Square.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, we’re not replacing dollars and cents, we need a better way to introduce money into the local economy. Square Rewards are almost like currency but they’re restricted to singular stores. What’s needed is a “reward” currency that’s accepted across a subset of merchants.</p>
<p>Square doesn’t need a cryptocurrency to do this, they could institute this as a setting very easily. However, Square-centric rewards would be a walled garden at risk for a liquidity trap. The ideal system would be vibrant and dynamic with easy entrance and exit.</p>
<p>Square and other POS providers should want a monetary system with predictable, steady velocity. For profit’s sake they should want a distributed system with low processing costs. Therefore, I think the ideal cryptocurrency for urban development looks something like freicoin.</p>
