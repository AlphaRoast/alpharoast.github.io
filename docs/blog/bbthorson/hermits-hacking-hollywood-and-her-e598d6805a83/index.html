<p>Holy hell, readers, what a week! We were feeling so energized having sent our first newsletter last Friday that we really went deep this week on podcasts. We decided to expand the slate of shows covered, so let us know what you think compared to last week!</p>
<p>The world is an uncertain place, but we found some pretty interesting stuff for you to devour this weekend. First, we did a deep dive on the Hermit Kingdom, North Korea. Then we move on to a few stories about renewable energy prompted by reports that the Russians have been trying to penetrate our energy grid. In lighter fare, since the news broke that J.J. Abrams is returning to direct <em>Star Wars: Episode IX</em>, we take you down the rabbit hole of Sci-Fi storytelling. Finally, Hillary Clinton has a new book out, and one of the most interesting things we learned is that apparently SHE LOVES PODCASTS.</p>
<p>As always, like, rate, and subscribe to these podcasts if you enjoy them because it’s absolutely crucial for the creators. Also, please tell everyone you’ve ever met to subscribe to our newsletter! We’ll be incredibly grateful.</p>

<p>The North Korean Kim dynasty has been nothing but enigmatic and Kim Jong Un is no exception. With a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/9/3/16248844/north-korea-nuclear-test-september-3-2017">successful test of a nuclear weapon</a>, tensions with the outside world are at an all time high. Somehow Kim Jong Un has successfully brought his vastly undersized and underpowered nation into the global conversation. Understanding North Korea is a Herculean task, but these stories should help you start.</p>

<p>Disney’s purchase of the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise has breathed new life into one of the most iconic movie franchises of all time. Last week, news broke that the director of Episode IX was leaving the film causing fan uncertainty. In likely the best possible outcome, J.J. Abrams — mastermind behind Episode VII and the <em>Star Trek</em> reboot — <a href="http://deadline.com/2017/09/jj-abrams-star-wars-episode-9-director-colin-trevorrow-lucasfilm-disney-1202167681/">is returning</a>.

<p>If you haven’t heard Hillary Clinton wrote a book about the 2016 election, we’re concerned about your exposure to news. There’s hot takes all over the internet, but one thing that definitely surprised us was the number of podcast interviews she lined up to promote her new book. It definitely seems to support the thesis that <a href="https://news.vice.com/story/podcasts-are-becoming-the-lefts-right-wing-talk-radio">podcasts are becoming the left’s right-wing talk radio</a>.</p>
